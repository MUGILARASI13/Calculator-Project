 Overview

This is a simple Java Console Calculator designed for beginners.
It performs basic arithmetic operations and also supports:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Square (x²)

Cube (x³)

Power (aⁿ)

Calculation History (stored using ArrayList from Java Collections)

The project helps you understand OOP concepts, Collections, switch-case, loops, and user input handling.
